# Rigol DS1052E Python Communication

## Introduction

This guide provides step-by-step instructions on how to connect a Rigol DS1052E oscilloscope to Python on a Windows system using the PyVISA library. The process involves installing the necessary software, checking for the device connection, and running a basic example to calibrate the scale of the oscilloscope.

## Prerequisites

- Rigol DS1052E oscilloscope
- USB cable for connecting the oscilloscope to the computer
- Python installed on your Windows machine
- Internet connection for downloading software

## Steps

### 1. Install Ultra Sigma

1. Download Ultra Sigma from Rigol's official website.
2. Install Ultra Sigma, which will automatically install the required driver for your device.
3. Connect the Rigol DS1052E oscilloscope to your computer using a USB cable.

### 2. Install PyVISA

Install PyVISA by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
pip install pyvisa
```

### 3. Check for Connection

Run the `check_for_connection.py` script to ensure that the oscilloscope is detected. If additional packages are required, follow the instructions provided in the error message.

```bash
python check_for_connection.py
```

### 4. Run the Example

Execute the `main.py` script, which is a basic example to adjust and calibrate the scale of the oscilloscope.

```bash
python main.py
```

### 5. Verify Connection

Ensure that the oscilloscope responds correctly to the commands in the example script. If successful, you should see the desired adjustments on the oscilloscope display.

### 6. Documentation

Update the README.md file to include the following sections:

#### Installation

Provide instructions for installing Ultra Sigma, PyVISA, and any additional packages.

```bash
# Ultra Sigma Installation
1. Download Ultra Sigma from [Rigol's official website](Rigol_website_link).
